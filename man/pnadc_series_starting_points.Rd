\title{Starting Points for SIDRA Series Mensalization}
\format{
A data.table with 159 rows and 3 columns:
\describe{
\item{series_name}{Character. Name of the SIDRA series}
\item{mesnotrim}{Integer. Month position in quarter (1, 2, or 3)}
\item{y0}{Numeric. Starting point value for this series and position}
}
}
\source{
Computed using \code{data-raw/generate_starting_points.R}
}
\usage{
data(pnadc_series_starting_points)
}
\description{
Pre-computed starting point values (y0) for mensalizing IBGE's rolling
quarterly series into exact monthly estimates.
}
\details{
These starting points were computed using the methodology from Hecksher (2024):
\enumerate{
\item Mensalized estimates were computed from PNADC microdata with calibrated
weights for the period 2013-2019
\item Cumulative variations were calculated from SIDRA rolling quarter data
\item Back-projection: e0 = mensalized - cumulative for each month
\item Starting points: y0 = mean(e0) by month position in quarter
}

The calibration period (2013-2019) was chosen because:
\itemize{
\item It includes stable pre-pandemic data
\item IBGE methodology was consistent during this period
\item Sufficient observations for reliable estimates
}
}
\section{When to Use Custom Starting Points}{

The bundled starting points are suitable for most users. Consider computing
custom starting points with \code{\link{compute_series_starting_points}} if:
\itemize{
\item IBGE makes major methodological changes to the PNADC
\item You need series not included in the bundled data
\item You want to use a different calibration period
}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# View bundled starting points
data(pnadc_series_starting_points)
head(pnadc_series_starting_points)

# See which series are available
unique(pnadc_series_starting_points$series_name)
}
